# Lock-Disk-Surface

### **📌 What is the Lock Disk Surface?**  
The **Lock Disk Surface** is a type of **parametric surface** in three-dimensional space. It is a special mathematical structure that resembles a **twisted ring or torus-like shape**. The surface is generated using two parameters \( u \) and \( v \), which are mapped to **\( x, y, z \)** coordinates.

It is called a **"Lock Disk"** because of its **symmetry and closed structure**, somewhat resembling a lock washer or a Möbius-like twisted disk.

### **📜 The Parametric Equations**
In your code, the surface is defined by the parametric equations:

where:  
- \( u \) and \( v \) range from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \).  
- \( u \) determines the position around the ring.  
- \( v \) influences the curvature and twisting effect.

### **🌍 Geometric Meaning**
- The **denominators** ensure the surface remains smooth and continuous, preventing sharp edges or singularities.  
- The **\( u \)** parameter moves the surface around in a circular fashion, while **\( v \)** creates variations that add depth and complexity.  
- The shape looks similar to a **twisted torus or Möbius-like surface** but has unique curvature properties.
